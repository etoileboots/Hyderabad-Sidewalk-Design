## Abstract
This project addresses the issue of pedestrian accessibility in Hyderabad, focusing on improving urban mobility through the development of inclusive and healthier walking infrastructure. The project identifies the lack of adequate sidewalks and walkways in the city, especially in areas such as Whitefields and Hitech City, and proposes design solutions that promote walking behavior, reduce vehicle emissions, and cater to underrepresented groups, including those with disabilities. Through research, participatory workshops, and AI-generated prototypes, the project aims to bridge the gap between current infrastructure shortcomings and the need for safe, accessible, and environmentally friendly public spaces.
